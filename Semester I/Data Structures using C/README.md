### List of Exercises for Lab  

### MCA Lab EXS-1  

1. **Write function sub-programs in C** to input some numbers into an array, print the content of the array, and sort them using **Bubble Sort Technique**.
2. **Write a function sub-program in C** to convert the temperature from Celsius scale to Fahrenheit scale. Use it in the main program to convert temperatures ranging from 0 to 100 degrees Celsius for every 10 degrees.
3. **Write a function sub-program** to return the **standard deviation** of numbers in an array. Use it in the main program to find and display the standard deviation of N numbers in the array (use any one of the formulas).
4. **Write function sub-programs in C** to return the length of a string and to make a duplicate of a string.

5. **Write a menu-driven program in C** to show the working of a **Linked List** containing nodes with a character string (array) as the data item and a link to the next node.  
   **Choices**:
   1. Insert a string (into an ordered list)
   2. Display the contents of the list
   3. Remove the first node
   4. Search for a given string in the list
   5. Remove the last node  
   *(Use string functions `strcpy()` & `strcmp()` to assign and compare strings)*
