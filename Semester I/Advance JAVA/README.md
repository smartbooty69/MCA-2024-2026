## Collection Framework

1. **ArrayList Methods**  
   Write a Java program that demonstrates the creation and implementation of various `ArrayList` methods. Traverse through the list before and after each operation.  
   [View Code](Semester%20I/Advance%20JAVA/Collection%20Framework/Prog01/prog01.java)

2. **LinkedList Operations**  
   Write a Java program that demonstrates the use of a linked list by performing linked list specific operations.  
   [View Code](path/to/LinkedListOperations.java)

3. **Unique Student IDs Management**  
   Write a program in Java to manage a set of unique student IDs for a university. Ensure that no duplicate IDs are present and perform various operations on this set of student IDs using the `HashSet` class.  
   [View Code](path/to/UniqueStudentIdsManagement.java)

4. **Course Management**  
   Write a Java program to:
   - Use a function `retrieveCourseFromDatabase()` to take `courseName`, `courseID`, and `courseCategory` as inputs.
   - Use `get()` and `set()` to store and retrieve data.
   - Display using `printCourseDetails(String courseName, String courseID, String courseCategory)`.
   - Update the `courseName` to "Computing in Java".

5. **Model View Controller (MVC)**  
   Write a program in Java to implement the Model View Controller architecture used in J2EE.

## Java Servlet and JSP

6. **Servlet Lifecycle**  
   Write a program in Java to demonstrate the various stages of a servlet lifecycle.  
   [View Code](path/to/ServletLifecycle.java)

7. **User Input with JSP**  
   Create a Java Server Page that displays a form to input the username and age. When submitted, the page will display the entered information and provide the current date and time using JSP elements.  
   [View Code](path/to/UserInputJSP.jsp)

8. **Form Handling in JSP**  
   Create a Java Server Page to display a form. When submitted, handle the request using both GET and POST methods. The form will accept the username, and based on the request method, the page will display a message.  
   [View Code](path/to/FormHandlingJSP.jsp)

9. **Session Handling with Cookies**  
   Write a program to handle sessions using cookies. It should print the username and email and implement various methods associated with it.  
   [View Code](path/to/CookieSessionHandling.java)

## JDBC - CreateStatement

1. **Student Records Management**  
   Create a Java program that connects to a MySQL database to manage a simple "student" records system using the `createStatement()` method:
   - **Create Database**: Create a database named `school_db`.
   - **Create Table**: Within `school_db`, create a table named `students` with the following structure:
     - `student_id` (INT, Primary Key, Auto Increment)
     - `name` (VARCHAR(100))
     - `age` (INT)
     - `grade` (VARCHAR(10))
   - **Insert Records**: Use the `createStatement()` method to insert at least three student records into the `students` table.
   - **Retrieve Records**: Use the same method to retrieve and display all records from the `students` table.
   - **Drop Table**: Write a statement to drop the `students` table to clean up.  
   [View Code](path/to/StudentRecordsManagement.java)

## JDBC - PreparedStatement

1. **Book Management System**  
   Create a Java program that connects to a MySQL database:
   - **Create Database**: Create a database named `library_db`.
   - **Create Table**: Create a table named `books` with the following structure:
     - `book_id` (INTEGER, Primary Key, Auto Increment)
     - `title` (TEXT)
     - `author` (TEXT)
     - `published_year` (INTEGER)
   - **Insert Records**: Implement a method that uses `PreparedStatement` to insert new book records. Prompt the user for the book's title, author, and published year.
   - **Retrieve Records**: Implement a method to retrieve and display all books in the `books` table.
   - **Update Records**: Implement a method to update the details of a book by its `book_id`. The user should be prompted for the `book_id` and the new details.
   - **Delete Records**: Implement a method to delete a book record based on its `book_id`.  
   [View Code](path/to/BookManagementSystem.java)

## JDBC â€“ CallableStatement

1. **Employee Management System**  
   Create a Java program that connects to a MySQL database and performs operations on an `employees` table using `CallableStatement`:
   - **Create Database**: Create a database named `company_db`.
   - **Create Table**: Create a table named `employees` with the following structure:
     - `emp_id` (INTEGER, Primary Key, Auto Increment)
     - `name` (TEXT)
     - `position` (TEXT)
     - `salary` (DECIMAL)
   - **Insert Records**: Write stored procedures in SQL to insert records.
   - **Retrieve Records**: Write stored procedures in SQL to retrieve records.  
   [View Code](path/to/EmployeeManagementSystem.java)

2. **CRUD Operations on Employees**  
   Create a Java program that connects to a MySQL database and performs CRUD operations on the `employees` table using `CallableStatement`:
   - **Create Database**: Create a database named `company_db`.
   - **Update Records**: Write stored procedures in SQL to update records.
   - **Delete Records**: Write stored procedures in SQL to delete records.  
   [View Code](path/to/EmployeeCRUDOperations.java)
