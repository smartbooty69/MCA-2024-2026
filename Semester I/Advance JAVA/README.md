### Getting Started

Welcome to the Advanced Java Programming Lab for the Master of Computer Applications program at St. Joseph’s University. This repository contains various programming assignments and projects focused on advanced Java concepts, including object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms, and Java frameworks. Follow the steps below to set up your environment and start working on the lab assignments.

#### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Download and install the latest version of the JDK from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or use [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/).

- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE):** Choose an IDE for writing and managing your Java code. Some popular options include:
  - **IntelliJ IDEA**
  - **Eclipse**
  - **NetBeans**
  
- **Basic Knowledge of Java:** Familiarity with Java syntax, object-oriented programming principles, and core libraries will help you complete the assignments successfully.

#### Cloning the Repository

To get started with the Advanced Java lab projects, clone the repository to your local machine. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smartbooty69/MCA-2024-2026.git
```

#### Project Structure

The projects are organized into directories based on their topics. Navigate to the **Advanced Java Programming Lab** folder to access the individual programming assignments. Each project is named sequentially (e.g., `Prog01.java`, `Prog02.java`, etc.) and contains the necessary Java code for implementing various advanced concepts.

#### Running the Projects

1. **Open Your IDE:**
   - Launch your chosen IDE.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   - Open the folder containing the Advanced Java lab files.

3. **Open the Java File:**
   - Open the desired Java program file (e.g., `Prog01.java`).

4. **Compile the Java Program:**
   - If using an IDE, you can usually compile the program using the built-in options. If using the command line, navigate to the directory of the Java file and run:
     ```bash
     javac Prog01.java
     ```

5. **Run the Compiled Program:**
   - After successful compilation, run the program using the command:
     ```bash
     java Prog01
     ```

6. **Verify Output:**
   - Check the console for output and any other results generated by your program. Modify the input or logic as necessary based on your assignment requirements.

#### Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you have enhancements or additional assignments, feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests. Ensure to follow best coding practices and comment your code for clarity.

4. **Course Management**  
   Write a Java program to:
   - Use a function `retrieveCourseFromDatabase()` to take `courseName`, `courseID`, and `courseCategory` as inputs.
   - Use `get()` and `set()` to store and retrieve data.
   - Display using `printCourseDetails(String courseName, String courseID, String courseCategory)`.
   - Update the `courseName` to "Computing in Java".

## JDBC - CreateStatement

1. **Student Records Management**  
   Create a Java program that connects to a MySQL database to manage a simple "student" records system using the `createStatement()` method:
   - **Create Database**: Create a database named `school_db`.
   - **Create Table**: Within `school_db`, create a table named `students` with the following structure:
     - `student_id` (INT, Primary Key, Auto Increment)
     - `name` (VARCHAR(100))
     - `age` (INT)
     - `grade` (VARCHAR(10))
   - **Insert Records**: Use the `createStatement()` method to insert at least three student records into the `students` table.
